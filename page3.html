       <font size="5"> <font color="white">Here is a list of some of the top games currently being developed by game development companies. These 
         companies spend countless hours creating amazing content for their users. Many developers work long hours and have deadlines to meet that can
         become stressful at times, but their love of game development triumphs. Apex Legends was released earlier this year by EA Sports and has already 
         become one of the top selling play games of the yeas. Super Smash brothers was release December of last year and has not been a dissapointment. 
         The remake of the Ninentdo 64 game was much wanted and Ninentdo delivered. If you have not heard of Fortnight you may be living under a rock.
         The most played game around the world continues to grow in users and does not seem to be stopping anytime soon. Zelda first released is an all time classic
         and with the Ninentdo release of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild , the legend continues to grow.
